# drlgrasp

Train kuka robot reach a point with deep rl in pybullet.

* **NOTE: The main brach is trained with spinup, and there are some issues with gpu and multi core CPUs at the same time, so this brach will be deprecated in the future. The rllib branch is trained with ray/rllib, and this branch will be mainly used in the future.**
* **The main branch will not update for a while, the rllib brach is the newest**

# Installation guide (Now only support linux and macos)
**I strongly recommend using Conda to install the env, because you will possible encounter the mpi4py error with pip.**

The spinningup rl library is the necessary lib.
first, you should install miniconda or anaconda.
second, install some dev dependencies.

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libopenmpi-dev
sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-glx
```
third, create a conda virtual environment
```bash
conda create -n spinningup python=3.6   #python 3.6 is recommended
```


```bash
#activate the env
conda activate spinningup
```

then, install spiningup,is contains almost dependencies
```bash
# clone my version, I made some changes.
git clone https://github.com/borninfreedom/spinningup.git
cd spinningup
pip install -e .
```

last, install torch and torchvision.

if you have a gpu, please run this (conda will install a correct version of cudatoolkit and cudnn in the virtual env, so don't care which version you have installed in your machine.)
```bash
# CUDA 10.1
conda install pytorch==1.4.0 torchvision==0.5.0 cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch
```

if you only have a cpu, please run this,
```bash
# CPU Only
conda install pytorch==1.4.0 torchvision==0.5.0 cpuonly -c pytorch
```



## view the train results through plot
```bash
python -m spinup.run plot ./logs
```
